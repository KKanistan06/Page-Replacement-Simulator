# Page Replacement Simulator Tool

This is a web-based simulator built with **React** that helps you understand and visualize four different Page Replacement Algorithms used in Operating Systems:

- **FIFO** (First-In-First-Out)
- **LRU** (Least Recently Used)
- **MFU** (Most Frequently Used)
- **LFU** (Least Frequently Used)

## 🔗 Live Demo

Check out the live simulator here: [Page Replacement Simulator](https://pagereplacementsimulatortool.netlify.app/)

## 🛠 Features

- Simple and intuitive interface
- Visual representation of page hits and faults
- Step-by-step simulation for each algorithm
- Custom input for page reference string and number of frames

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- React JS
- HTML5 & CSS3
- JavaScript
